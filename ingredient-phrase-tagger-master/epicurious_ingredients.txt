*Tamarind paste tends to be a South Asian product; it usually comes in a jar and is available in many supermarkets. Its smooth texture makes it easier and faster to use than the traditional Thai blocks of tamarind pulp that include the fruit's seeds and fibers. Read the label carefully to see if the tamarind paste is sweetened or not; if the jar you purchase contains a sweetener, just use less sugar in your seasoning sauce.

Allow the nuts to cool for at least 10 minutes before chopping them very briefly in a blender or food processor.

*Caul fat is a weblike membrane of fatty material that encases the organs of some animals, including pigs, sheep, and cows. When wrapped around meat or fish, it adds flavor, moisture, and fat, and basically melts into the meat or fish as it cooks. Some butchers and specialty markets carry caul fat, but you may need to ask your butcher or supermarket meat counter to order it. If you can't find caul fat, try wrapping the halibut in thin strips of bacon.

*Tamarind sauce—of course you can buy this already prepared, but it's an entirely different sauce when it's fresh: place a small handful (about 2 to 3 tablespoons) of dried, vacu-packed tamarind nuggets in a bowl and cover with very hot water for about 5 to 10 minutes to soften. Use your hands to squish the nuggets until the water becomes really thick and gloopy. You'll notice your hands getting really soft, so spread a good amount of it all over your arms and face. Great for the skin. Anyway, using a rubber spatula, rub the sauce through a strainer, leaving the pits behind. Store the sauce in an airtight mason jar (keeps about a week). Rinse off your arms and face.
